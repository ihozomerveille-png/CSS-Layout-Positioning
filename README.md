 Campus Information Website

 Project Description
This project is a single-page campus information website designed to present important campus services, locations, and announcements. The goal of the project is to demonstrate layout organization, navigation structure, positioning techniques, and responsive web design using HTML and CSS.

 Layout and Responsiveness Overview
The website includes a fixed navigation bar with dropdown menus for easy navigation between sections. Different layout techniques such as Flexbox are used to organize service cards and gallery content. A sticky announcement notice remains visible while scrolling to highlight important information. Media queries are used to adjust layouts, spacing, and visibility of elements to ensure the website works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
